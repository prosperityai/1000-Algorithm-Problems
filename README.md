<h2><b>These are coding interview questions gathered from different resources.</b></h2>

<b>Do you have questions from Google / Facebook / Microsoft / Amazon?<b>

Every single one of these questions have been asked in an actual interview from a top-tier tech company. They are also among the more difficult problems that are asked, it's better to be overprepared than underprepared.


<b>How long should I spend solving each problem?</b>

Each problem is designed to be able to be solved in an hour in a real-life interview.


<b>What topics are covered?</b>

I have the following areas I pick from. However, the questions will be chosen with a distribution that's more aligned with what you get in the actual interviews.

<li><b>Linked Lists</b></li>
<li><b>Heaps</b></li>
<li><b>Trees</b></li>
<li><b>Graphs</b></li>
<li><b>Randomized Algorithms</b></li>
<li><b>Functional Algorithms</b></li>
<li><b>Dynamic Programming and Backtracking</b></li>
<li><b>Arrays</b></li>
<li><b>Stacks and Queues</b></li>
<li><b>Strings</b></li>
<li><b>Bit Manipulation</b></li>
<li><b>Object Oriented Design</b></li>
<li><b>Networking and Distributed Systems</b></li>
<li><b>Systems Design</b></li>

<b>What language are your solutions in?</b>

My solutions are in Python.I think it's the best language to use for interviews, as it's well-known and very similar to pseudocode.
